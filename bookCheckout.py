"""

A Python module which contains functions used to ask 
the librarian for borrowerâ€™s member-ID and the ID of 
the book(s) to be checked out. Then, after performing 
the validity checks and functionality described in the 
previous section, the program should return a message 
letting the librarian know whether they have checked 
out the book(s) successfully.
